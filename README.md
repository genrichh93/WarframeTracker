# Warframe Mastery Dashboard

![Dashboard Screenshot](./screenshots/dashboard.png) <!-- Replace this with a link to a good screenshot of your app's dashboard -->

A comprehensive, local desktop application for tracking your Warframe mastery progress, live game events, and resource requirements. Built with Python and Tkinter for a native cross-platform experience.

This application fetches all necessary data from official and community-maintained sources, stores it in a local database, and provides a powerful and responsive interface to manage and view your progress towards mastering every item in Warframe.

## Features

-   **üìä Interactive Dashboard:**
    -   Calculates and displays your current Mastery Rank and progress to the next rank.

    -   Shows a breakdown of your Mastery XP progress by category with an animated bar chart.

-   **üìù Detailed Mastery-Tracker:**
    -   Browse all masterable items across every category (Warframes, Weapons, Companions, Vehicles, Amps, Necramechs).
    -   Track the Star Chart, including Steel Path completion.
    -   Update item status with a double-click, right-click context menu, or keyboard shortcuts (`m` for Mastered, `s` for Missing, etc.).
    -   Persistent column sorting that remains even after updating item statuses.
    -   Powerful search and filtering options (Hide Mastered, Hide Primes).
    -   Context-aware UI that adapts filters and detail views for different categories.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or newer.
-   `pip` (Python's package installer).

### Installation

1.  **Download wftracker.py:**


4.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    python wftracker.py
    ```

### First Time Setup
On the very first launch, the application will detect an empty database. It will automatically download all necessary item, node, relic, and recipe data from online sources and populate the local database (`warframe_data.db`). This process may take a minute or two. The status bar at the bottom will show the progress. Subsequent launches will be much faster.

## Usage

-   **Dashboard:** Your main overview. Click "Refresh Charts" to update the visuals after making changes.
-   **Mastery-Tracker:**
    -   Click any category on the left to filter the list.
    -   Double-click an item to toggle its status between "Mastered" and "Missing".
    -   Right-click one or more items to set a specific status or open the Warframe Wiki page.
    -   Use the search bar to filter the list by name.
-   **Resource Tracker:**
    -   This tab automatically calculates required resources when you switch to it.
    -   Right-click any resource to find its drop locations (which will be shown in the Mastery-Tracker tab) or open its wiki page.

## Data Sources

This application would not be possible without the amazing work of the Warframe community. All data is sourced from the following projects:

-   **[WFCD (Warframe Community Developers)](https://github.com/WFCD/warframe-items/):** Provides the comprehensive `All.json` file for item data.
-   **[warframestat.us](https://docs.warframestat.us/):** Provides the API for all live game state data (world cycles, sorties, traders, etc.).
-   **[Warframe Wiki](https://wiki.warframe.com/):** The primary source for images and the target for all "Open in Wiki" actions.
